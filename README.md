## üéØ Learning Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Don't skip the math** - It seems hard but it's essential
2. **Code along** - Don't just read, implement!
3. **Use visualizations** - They make concepts click
4. **Start simple** - Master basics before advanced topics
5. **Practice regularly** - 1 hour/day beats 7 hours once/week

### For Interview Prep
1. **Understand, don't memorize** - Interviewers can tell
2. **Practice explaining** - Say answers out loud
3. **Draw diagrams** - Visual explanations are powerful
4. **Know the tradeoffs** - Every algorithm has pros/cons
5. **Real examples** - Have specific experiences ready

### For Production ML
1. **Data quality first** - GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)
2. **Start simple** - Linear regression beats complex model done wrong
3. **Monitor everything** - Models degrade in production
4. **Explain predictions** - Stakeholders need interpretability
5. **Version everything** - Data, code, models, hyperparameters
