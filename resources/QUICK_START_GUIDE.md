1. Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install Anaconda from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/)
3. Create your first environment:
```bash
conda create -n ml_starter python=3.9
conda activate ml_starter
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

4. Test installation:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**Checkpoint:** Jupyter opens in your browser âœ…

#### Afternoon (90 minutes): Your First ML Model
1. Open [`interactive_demos/01_getting_started.ipynb`](../interactive_demos/01_getting_started.ipynb)
2. Read through Section 1: "What is Machine Learning?"
3. Run the "House Price Prediction" example
4. Modify one parameter and re-run

**What you'll learn:**
- What ML actually does
- How to load data
- How to train a model
- How to make predictions

**End of day goal:** You've run a real ML model! ðŸŽ‰

---

### Day 2: Understanding the Math

**Time: 2 hours**

#### Focus: Just the Essential Math

Open [`interactive_demos/02_mathematics.ipynb`](../interactive_demos/02_mathematics.ipynb)

**Morning (60 minutes): Vectors & Matrices**
- Complete Section 2.1: "Vectors" (theory + exercises)

**Key insight:** ML is about finding the best line (or curve) through data points. Calculus helps us find that "best" line.

**Practice:**
```python
# You should understand this by end of day
import numpy as np

# Data: house size (sq ft) and price ($)
X = np.array([1000, 1500, 2000])
y = np.array([200000, 300000, 400000])

# Find best fit line
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Predict
new_house_size = 1750
predicted_price = model.predict([[new_house_size]])
print(f"Predicted price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.0f}")
```

---

### Day 3: Data Processing

**Time: 2.5 hours**

#### Real-world data is messy! Learn to clean it.

Open [`interactive_demos/04_data_processing.ipynb`](../interactive_demos/04_data_processing.ipynb)

**Morning (75 minutes): Loading & Exploring Data**
1. Section 1: "Loading Data" (CSV, Excel)

**Hands-on exercise:** Download Titanic dataset from Kaggle
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')

# Explore
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

# Handle missing values
df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)

# Encode categorical
df['Sex'] = df['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})

# Check result
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Should be much smaller!
```

**End of day goal:** Comfortable loading, exploring, and cleaning a dataset.

---

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load famous iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
```

**End of day goal:** Understand classification and can train 3 different classifiers.

---

### Day 5: Model Evaluation

**Time: 2 hours**

overfit_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=20)

# Good model
good_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)

# Compare with cross-validation
overfit_scores = cross_val_score(overfit_model, X, y, cv=5)
good_scores = cross_val_score(good_model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Overfit model: {overfit_scores.mean():.2%}")

## Common Questions

### "I don't understand the math!"
**A:** That's normal! Focus on the intuition first:
- Linear regression: Find the best line through points
- Gradient descent: Take small steps downhill to find the minimum
- Backpropagation: Update weights based on errors

Math details can come later. Many successful ML engineers started with minimal math.

### "My model has low accuracy!"
**A:** Common causes:
1. **Too little data** â†’ Get more data or use simpler model
2. **Dirty data** â†’ Check for missing values, outliers
3. **Wrong algorithm** â†’ Try different models
4. **Not enough features** â†’ Feature engineering
5. **Hyperparameters not tuned** â†’ Try different settings

See [Debugging ML Models](../guides/production/DEBUGGING_ML_MODELS.md)

### "Should I learn TensorFlow or PyTorch?"
**A:** For Week 1, stick with **scikit-learn**. It's simpler and covers 80% of real-world use cases.

Learn deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) in Month 2+.

### "How long until I can get a job?"
**A:** Realistic timeline:
- **3 months** - Junior roles (with strong portfolio)
- **6 months** - Mid-level roles (with projects + theory)
- **12 months** - Senior roles (with specialization)

See [ML_CAREER_ROADMAP.md](./ML_CAREER_ROADMAP.md)

### "I'm stuck on Day X!"
**A:** That's expected! ML has a learning curve.
- Take an extra day if needed
- Ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [r/learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/)
- See [Getting Help](#getting-help) below

### "Do I need a GPU?"
**A:** Not for Week 1! CPU is fine for:
- Classical ML (scikit-learn)
- Small datasets
- Learning fundamentals

You'll need GPU for:
- Deep learning (Month 2+)
- Large models
- Training on big datasets

**Free GPU options:** Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels

---

## Getting Help

### Free Resources
- **Stack Overflow** - Technical questions
- **r/learnmachinelearning** - Community support
- **Discord Servers**:
  - [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python)
  - [Machine Learning](https://discord.gg/machinelearning)
- **GitHub Discussions** - [Our repo discussions](https://github.com/benuh/ML_AL_Notes/discussions)

### Asking Good Questions
When stuck, provide:
1. What you're trying to do
2. What you expected
3. What actually happened
4. Your code (minimal example)
5. Error message (if any)

**Good question:**
> "I'm trying to train a linear regression model on the Boston housing dataset. I expected the RÂ² score to be around 0.7, but I'm getting 0.3. Here's my code: [code]. The error is: [error]. What am I doing wrong?"

**Bad question:**
> "My model doesn't work. Help!"

---

## Day 7 Quiz Answers

1. **Regression vs Classification:**
   Regression predicts continuous numbers (e.g., price). Classification predicts categories (e.g., spam/not spam).

2. **Why split data:**
   To evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Training on all data would give overly optimistic performance.

3. **Overfitting:**
   Model memorizes training data but performs poorly on new data. Prevent by: using train/test split, cross-validation, regularization, or simpler models.

4. **Regression algorithms:**
   Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor (also: Lasso, Ridge, SVR)

5. **Classification algorithms:**
   Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier (also: SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes)

6. **Spam detector metrics:**
   Precision (% of flagged emails that are actually spam) and Recall (% of actual spam that was caught). F1-score combines both.

7. **Missing data:**
   Remove rows/columns, fill with mean/median/mode, or use sophisticated imputation methods.

8. **Feature scaling:**
   Normalizes features to similar ranges (e.g., 0-1) so models train faster and perform better. Essential for algorithms like gradient descent.
