## How to Read a Research Paper

### ❌ DON'T: Read linearly from start to finish
### ✅ DO: Use the Three-Pass Method

### **Pass 1: The Quick Scan (5-10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Decide if paper is worth reading

**Read:**
- ✅ Title and abstract
- ✅ Introduction (first paragraph + last paragraph)
- ✅ Section and subsection headings
- ✅ Conclusion
- ✅ Figures and tables (captions only)
- ✅ References (glance for familiar names)

**Ask yourself:**
- What is the main contribution?
- Is this paper relevant to my work/interests?
- Is it well-written and rigorous?
- Do I have the background to understand it?

**Outcome:** ⭐ Keep or discard paper

---

### **Pass 2: The Understanding Pass (30-60 minutes)**

**Goal:** Understand the main ideas and results

**Read:**
- ✅ Introduction (carefully)
- ✅ Related work (to understand context)
- ✅ Method section (focus on diagrams and key equations)
- ✅ Experiments and results (all figures and tables)
- ✅ Conclusion (carefully)
- ⏭️ Skip: Detailed proofs, minor implementation details

**Take notes on:**
- Main contributions (3-5 bullet points)
- Key ideas and intuitions
- Novel techniques or architectures
- Experimental setup and datasets
- Performance improvements over baselines
- Limitations mentioned by authors

**Outcome:** 🎯 Can explain paper to someone else (high-level)

---

### **Pass 3: The Deep Dive (2-4 hours)**

**Goal:** Fully understand the paper in depth

**Read:**
- ✅ Everything, including appendix
- ✅ Derivations and proofs
- ✅ Implementation details
- ✅ Related papers (cited works)

**Recreate:**
- Derive key equations yourself
- Implement algorithms in pseudocode
- Reproduce experimental setup
- Critique assumptions

**Ask critical questions:**
- What are the implicit assumptions?
