```
Alert: HighErrorRate
Condition: error_rate > 1% for 5 minutes
Triggered: 2024-01-15 10:15:32 UTC
Severity: Critical
Channel: PagerDuty + Slack #incidents
```

### Detection Effectiveness
- ✅ Alert fired quickly (< 5 min from issue start)
- ✅ Clear alert message
- ⚠️ Improvement: Could have fired earlier with lower threshold

## Root Cause Analysis

### Symptoms
1. High error rate (13% vs normal 0.05%)
2. Errors: "Database connection timeout"
3. Latency spike (p99 from 450ms to 8000ms)
4. Database CPU at 95%

### Investigation Steps
1. **Initial hypothesis:** Recent deployment caused issue
   - Checked: No recent deployments ❌

2. **Second hypothesis:** Traffic spike overwhelmed system
   - Checked: Traffic normal (~1000 RPS) ❌

3. **Third hypothesis:** Database issue
   - Checked: Database connection pool exhausted ✅
   - Found: Connection leaks in recent code change

### Root Cause
**Primary:** Database connection pool exhausted due to connection leak

**Contributing Factors:**
1. Code change 2 days ago introduced connection leak
2. Gradual leak went undetected (monitoring gap)
3. Connection pool size too small to handle leak
4. No connection timeout configured

### Why Didn't We Catch This Earlier?
1. Connection pool metrics not monitored
2. Integration tests didn't stress connection pool
3. Gradual leak took 48 hours to manifest
4. Staging environment uses smaller load (didn't reproduce)

### The Five Whys
1. **Why did the service fail?**
   - Database connection pool was exhausted

2. **Why was the connection pool exhausted?**
   - Connections were being leaked and not returned to pool

3. **Why were connections being leaked?**
   - Recent code change didn't properly close connections in error path

4. **Why didn't code review catch this?**
   - Error path wasn't explicitly tested in code review
   - No linting rule to enforce connection cleanup

5. **Why didn't tests catch this?**
   - Unit tests mocked database connections
   - Integration tests didn't run long enough to detect leak

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix (Mitigation)
```python
# Emergency fix: Increased connection pool size
# Before
DB_POOL_SIZE = 20

# After
DB_POOL_SIZE = 100  # Temporary increase to handle leak
```

**Deployed:** 10:30 UTC
**Effect:** Error rate dropped from 13% to 2%
**Full Resolution:** 10:42 UTC after connections naturally released

### Permanent Fix
```python
# Fixed connection leak in error handling
# Before (leaked connection)
def get_features(user_id):
    conn = db_pool.get_connection()
    try:
        result = conn.execute(query)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
        raise  # Connection never returned!

# After (properly closes connection)
def get_features(user_id):
    conn = db_pool.get_connection()
    try:
        result = conn.execute(query)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        conn.close()  # Always return connection
```

**Deployed:** 12:00 UTC (after code review)
**Verification:** Monitored for 24 hours - no leak detected

### Verification Steps
- [ ] Connection pool usage returned to normal (< 20 connections)
- [ ] Error rate at baseline (< 0.1%)
- [ ] Latency at baseline (p99 < 500ms)
- [ ] No related alerts for 24 hours
- [ ] Connection pool metrics stable

```

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

#### Feature Categories

**1. Transaction Features (Real-time)**
```python
transaction_features = {
    'amount': transaction.amount,
    'merchant_id': transaction.merchant_id,
    'merchant_category': transaction.merchant_category,
    'currency': transaction.currency,
    'card_present': transaction.card_present,
    'online_transaction': transaction.online_transaction,
    'cross_border': transaction.country != user.home_country,
    'amount_deviation': (amount - user_avg_amount) / user_std_amount,
    'hour_of_day': transaction.timestamp.hour,
    'day_of_week': transaction.timestamp.day_of_week,
}
```

**2. User Historical Features (Batch - Redis)**
```python
user_features = {
    'total_transactions_30d': 45,
    'total_spend_30d': 2340.50,
    'avg_transaction_amount': 52.01,
    'std_transaction_amount': 31.25,
    'num_unique_merchants_30d': 18,
    'num_countries_30d': 2,
    'account_age_days': 720,
}
```

**3. Velocity Features (Real-time computation)**
```python
velocity_features = {
    'transactions_last_1h': get_count(user_id, window='1h'),
    'transactions_last_24h': get_count(user_id, window='24h'),
    'amount_last_1h': get_sum(user_id, window='1h', field='amount'),
    'amount_last_24h': get_sum(user_id, window='24h', field='amount'),
    'unique_merchants_last_1h': get_unique(user_id, window='1h', field='merchant_id'),
}
```

**4. Location Features**
```python
location_features = {
    'location_lat': transaction.latitude,
    'location_lon': transaction.longitude,
    'distance_from_last_transaction_km': haversine_distance(
        last_txn_location, current_txn_location
    ),
    'impossible_travel': is_impossible_travel(
        last_txn_location, current_txn_location, time_diff
    ),  # e.g., 1000km in 1 hour
    'new_country': transaction.country not in user.historical_countries,
}
```

**5. Device Features**
```python
device_features = {
    'device_id': hash(transaction.device_id),
    'device_type': transaction.device_type,  # mobile/desktop
    'new_device': transaction.device_id not in user.known_devices,
    'ip_address_hash': hash(transaction.ip_address),
    'ip_reputation_score': external_api.get_ip_reputation(ip_address),
}
```

#### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
class FeatureEngineer:
    def __init__(self, redis_client, external_api):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.external_api = external_api

    async def extract_features(self, transaction, user_id):
        """Extract all features for a transaction"""
        # Parallel execution for speed
        tasks = [
            self._get_transaction_features(transaction),
            self._get_user_features(user_id),
            self._get_velocity_features(user_id, transaction.timestamp),
            self._get_location_features(transaction, user_id),
            self._get_device_features(transaction, user_id),
        ]

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

        # Combine all features
        features = {**results[0], **results[1], **results[2],
                    **results[3], **results[4]}

        return features

    def _get_user_features(self, user_id):
        """Fetch pre-computed user features from Redis"""
        key = f"user_features:{user_id}"
        features = self.redis.get(key)
        return json.loads(features) if features else self._default_user_features()
```

### 4.3 Model Architecture

#### Two-Stage Approach

**Stage 1: Rule Engine (Deterministic)**
```python
class RuleEngine:
    @staticmethod
    def check_rules(transaction, features):
        """Check for obvious fraud patterns"""

        # Rule 1: Impossible travel
        if features['impossible_travel']:
            return True, "Impossible travel detected", 0.99

        # Rule 2: Amount extremely high for user
        if features['amount_deviation'] > 10:  # 10 std devs
            return True, "Amount anomaly", 0.95

        # Rule 3: Excessive velocity
        if features['transactions_last_1h'] > 20:
            return True, "Excessive velocity", 0.90

        # Rule 4: High-risk country + new device
        if features['high_risk_country'] and features['new_device']:
            return True, "High-risk pattern", 0.85

        return False, None, 0.0
```

**Stage 2: ML Ensemble Model**
```python
class FraudEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load models
        self.xgboost_model = load_model('xgboost_v3.pkl')
        self.nn_model = load_model('neural_net_v2.h5')
        self.weights = [0.6, 0.4]  # XGBoost weight, NN weight

    def predict_proba(self, features):
        """Ensemble prediction"""
        # XGBoost prediction
        xgb_score = self.xgboost_model.predict_proba(features)[0][1]

        # Neural network prediction
        nn_score = self.nn_model.predict(features)[0][0]

        # Weighted ensemble
        ensemble_score = (
            self.weights[0] * xgb_score +
            self.weights[1] * nn_score
        )

        return ensemble_score
```

@dag(schedule_interval='@daily')
def fraud_model_training():

    @task
    def extract_training_data():
        """Extract last 90 days of labeled data"""
        query = """
        SELECT * FROM transactions
        WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
        AND fraud_label IS NOT NULL

from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

fraud_predictions = Counter(
    'fraud_predictions_total',
    'Total fraud predictions',
    ['decision']  # APPROVE, REVIEW, DECLINE

## 5. Trade-offs & Design Decisions (PROBLEM Framework - L)

### Trade-off 1: Latency vs Accuracy
| Approach | Latency | Accuracy | Decision |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Simple rules only | 5ms | Low (80% AUC) | ❌ Too many missed frauds |
| Complex deep learning | 200ms | High (95% AUC) | ❌ Too slow for payment flow |
| Ensemble (XGBoost + NN) | 30ms | Good (92% AUC) | ✅ **Selected** |

**Decision:** Two-stage approach (rules + ML ensemble)
- Rules catch obvious cases (<5ms)
- ML handles nuanced cases (~30ms)
- Total p99 latency: <50ms ✅

### Trade-off 2: Batch vs Real-time Features
| Feature Type | Freshness | Latency | Cost | Decision |
|--------------|-----------|---------|------|----------|
| All real-time | Fresh | High (100ms+) | High | ❌ |
| All batch | Stale (24h lag) | Low (5ms) | Low | ❌ |
| Hybrid | Mixed | Medium (30ms) | Medium | ✅ **Selected** |

**Decision:** Hybrid approach
- Batch features (user history) in Redis
- Real-time features (velocity, location) computed on-demand
- Best balance of freshness and latency

### Trade-off 3: Model Complexity
| Model | Training Time | Inference Time | Accuracy | Interpretability |
|-------|---------------|----------------|----------|------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 5 min | 1ms | 85% AUC | High |
| XGBoost | 2 hours | 5ms | 91% AUC | Medium |
| Deep Learning | 12 hours | 15ms | 93% AUC | Low |
| Ensemble (XGB+NN) | 14 hours | 30ms | 92% AUC | Medium |

**Decision:** Ensemble of XGBoost + Neural Network
- XGBoost: Interpretable, fast, handles tabular data well
- NN: Captures complex interactions
- Weighted ensemble: Best overall performance

### Trade-off 4: False Positives vs False Negatives
```
Business Context:
- False Positive cost: ~$2 (customer friction, manual review)
- False Negative cost: ~$150 (average fraud loss)

Optimal threshold analysis:
- Threshold 0.5: 92% precision, 85% recall (balanced)
- Threshold 0.7: 95% precision, 78% recall (fewer FP, more FN)
- Threshold 0.3: 87% precision, 91% recall (more FP, fewer FN)
```

**Decision:** Three-tier system
- Score > 0.9: Decline (high confidence)
- Score 0.5-0.9: Manual review
- Score < 0.5: Approve

Minimizes both customer friction and fraud losses.

## 6. Edge Cases & Scaling (PROBLEM Framework - E)

### Edge Cases

**1. Cold Start (New Users)**
- **Problem:** No historical features for new users
- **Solution:**
  - Use population-level features
  - Weight device/location features more heavily
  - More conservative thresholds (review instead of approve)

**2. Data Quality Issues**
```python
def handle_missing_features(features):
    """Handle missing or invalid features gracefully"""

    # Critical features missing: Reject safely
    critical_features = ['amount', 'merchant_id', 'user_id']
    if any(features.get(f) is None for f in critical_features):
        return "REVIEW", 0.5  # Safe default

    # Non-critical features: Use defaults
    features.setdefault('transactions_last_1h', 0)
    features.setdefault('avg_transaction_amount', median_transaction_amount)

    return features
```

**3. Model Staleness**
- **Problem:** Model performance degrades over time (fraud patterns evolve)
- **Solution:**
  - Daily retraining with latest data
  - A/B test new model vs production
  - Gradual rollout
  - Alert if performance < threshold

**4. Feature Store Failure**
- **Problem:** Redis down, can't get user features
- **Solution:**
  - Fallback to DynamoDB (slower but available)
  - Use transaction features only (degraded mode)
  - More conservative decisions during outage

### Scaling Considerations

**Traffic Growth**
| Metric | Current | 1 Year | 3 Years | Strategy |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| TPS | 10,000 | 30,000 | 100,000 | Horizontal scaling |
| Latency SLA | 50ms | 50ms | 50ms | Optimize, CDN |
| Storage | 100GB | 300GB | 1TB | Partition by user_id |

**Scaling Strategies:**
1. **Horizontal Scaling:** Auto-scale API instances (Kubernetes HPA)
2. **Caching:** Redis cluster with read replicas
3. **Feature Store Partitioning:** Shard by user_id hash
4. **Model Optimization:** Quantization, pruning for faster inference
5. **Geographic Distribution:** Deploy regionally to reduce latency

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance (PROBLEM Framework - M)

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Operational Metrics:**
- Request rate (TPS)
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Availability

**Model Performance:**
- Prediction distribution (fraud rate)
- Online metrics (when feedback available)
- Feature drift (KS test vs training data)
- Model confidence distribution

**Business Metrics:**
- Fraud loss ($ prevented)
- False positive rate (customer friction)
- Manual review queue size
- Customer complaints

### Alerting
| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| High latency | p99 > 100ms | Scale up, investigate |
| Prediction shift | Fraud rate changed >20% | Check data quality |
| Feature drift | KS test p < 0.01 | Investigate, retrain |
| Performance drop | Online AUC < 0.85 | Rollback, investigate |

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Weekly:** Review flagged transactions, update rules
2. **Monthly:** Retrain with latest fraud patterns
3. **Quarterly:** Deep dive on false positives/negatives
4. **Annually:** Redesign features, try new models

## Final Thoughts

- **Consistency > Intensity**: Study 2-3 hours daily rather than cramming
- **Practice Out Loud**: Simulate real interview conditions
- **Focus on Weak Areas**: Don't just practice what you're good at
- **Stay Healthy**: Exercise, sleep, eat well
- **Stay Positive**: Rejections are learning opportunities
- **Multiple Applications**: Apply to 10-20 companies
- **Negotiate**: Don't accept the first offer, always negotiate

**Good luck! 🚀**
