   cp -r /path/to/your/original/ML_AL_Notes/* .

   # Or if you're already in the ML_AL_Notes directory:
   # Just proceed to the next step
   ```

5. **Upload to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Add all files
   git add .

   # Commit with meaningful message
   git commit -m "🚀 Initial upload: Complete ML/AI learning curriculum with 10 modules, interactive demos, and capstone projects"

   # Push to GitHub
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Initialize in Your Existing Directory

If you want to upload from your current ML_AL_Notes directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/benjaminhu/Desktop/Benjamin/Projects/Github/ML_AL_Notes

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Initial commit
git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit: Complete ML/AI learning curriculum

- 10 comprehensive modules from foundations to advanced topics
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks and Python implementations
- 3 real-world capstone projects
- Extensive visualization and hands-on exercises
- Properly sourced with academic references
- Ready-to-use setup with requirements.txt"

# Add remote repository (create this on GitHub first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML_AL_Notes.git

# Create main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 Before Uploading - File Check

Run these commands to verify your files are ready:

```bash
# Check file structure
ls -la

# Verify Python dependencies
cat requirements.txt

# Test if notebooks work (optional)
jupyter notebook --list

# Check git status
git status
```

## 📊 Large Files Warning

**Important**: Some files might be too large for GitHub:

### Files to Check:
- Large datasets in `datasets/`
- Model files (*.h5, *.pkl, *.joblib)
- Generated images or outputs

### Solution for Large Files:

1. **Add to .gitignore** (already done):
   ```bash
   # Large files are already in .gitignore
   echo "*.h5" >> .gitignore
   echo "datasets/large/" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Use Git LFS** for essential large files:
   ```bash
   # Install Git LFS
   git lfs install

   # Track large files
   git lfs track "*.h5"
   git lfs track "*.pkl"

   # Commit .gitattributes
   git add .gitattributes
   git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking for large files"
   ```

## 🎨 Making Your Repository Attractive

### Add Repository Topics:
On GitHub, add these topics to your repository:
