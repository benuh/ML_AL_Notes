## üéØ Why Ethics Matters

### Real-World Examples of AI Failures

**1. COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm (2016)**
```
Problem: Predicted future criminal behavior
Finding: Black defendants flagged at 2x rate of white defendants
         despite similar actual recidivism rates

Impact: Used in sentencing decisions
        Reinforced racial disparities in justice system

Lesson: Historical bias in data ‚Üí biased predictions
```

**2. Amazon Recruiting Tool (2018)**
```
Problem: AI screened resumes for software engineers
Finding: Downranked resumes with "women's" on them
         (e.g., "women's chess club captain")

Impact: Discriminated against female candidates
        Amazon scrapped the system

Lesson: Training data from biased past ‚Üí biased model
```

**3. Healthcare Algorithm Bias (2019)**
```
Problem: Predicted which patients need extra medical care
Finding: Black patients systematically scored lower risk
         than equally sick white patients

Impact: Affected 200 million people
        Reduced access to care for black patients

Lesson: Using "cost" as proxy for "health need" introduced bias
        (black patients historically receive less care ‚Üí lower costs)
```

**4. Facial Recognition Bias (2018)**
```
Problem: Commercial facial recognition systems
Finding: Error rates:
         - White males: 0.8%
         - Black females: 34.7%

Impact: False arrests, surveillance bias
        Misidentification in security systems

Lesson: Training data not representative ‚Üí disparate performance
```

## üîç Types of Bias

### 1. Historical Bias

**Definition:** Bias from real-world inequalities reflected in data

**Example:**
```python
# Loan approval dataset
# Historical data: Women denied loans more often (due to past discrimination)
# Model learns: Female gender ‚Üí Deny loan

data = {
    'gender': ['M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F'],
    'approved': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  # Historical bias
}

# Model perpetuates bias
model.fit(data['gender'], data['approved'])
# Even if women are now equally qualified, model discriminates
```

**Mitigation:**
- Question data sources
- Understand historical context
- Don't blindly optimize for historical outcomes

### 2. Representation Bias

**Definition:** Training data doesn't represent target population

**Example:**
```python
# Facial recognition training data
training_data = {
    'white_males': 50_000,
    'white_females': 40_000,
    'black_males': 5_000,
    'black_females': 3_000,  # Severely underrepresented
    'asian_males': 2_000,
    'asian_females': 1_000
}

# Model performs poorly on underrepresented groups
# Black females: 35% error rate
# White males: 1% error rate
```

**Mitigation:**
- Collect diverse, representative data
- Oversample minority groups
- Data augmentation for underrepresented classes

### 3. Measurement Bias

**Definition:** Features don't accurately measure what you intend

**Example:**
```python
# Hiring model uses "years of experience"
# Problem: Career breaks (often mothers) penalized

features = {
    'years_experience': 5,  # Appears less qualified
    # Missing: actual skill level, productivity
}

# Better approach: Direct skill assessment
better_features = {
    'coding_test_score': 95,
    'project_portfolio_quality': 4.5,
    'technical_interview': 'strong'
}
```

**Mitigation:**
- Choose features carefully
- Validate measurements
- Use multiple indicators

### 4. Aggregation Bias

**Definition:** One-size-fits-all model doesn't work for all groups

**Example:**
```python
# Medical diagnosis model
# Trained on majority population
# Different symptoms for different groups

# Heart attack symptoms:
men = ['chest_pain', 'left_arm_pain']
women = ['nausea', 'jaw_pain', 'fatigue']  # Different!

# Model trained mostly on men misses women's heart attacks
```

**Mitigation:**
- Train group-specific models
- Include interaction terms
- Validate across subgroups

### 5. Evaluation Bias

**Definition:** Test data doesn't represent deployment scenario

**Example:**
```python
# Speech recognition
# Tested on: Professional voice actors (clear speech)
# Used by: Everyone (accents, background noise, dialects)

test_accuracy = 98%  # On clean data
real_world_accuracy = 65%  # On actual users

# Overestimated performance
```

**Mitigation:**
- Test on diverse, realistic data
- Include edge cases
- Continuous monitoring in production

### 6. Deployment Bias

**Definition:** System used differently than intended

**Example:**
```
Intended: Teacher tool to identify struggling students
Actual use: Administrator tool to evaluate teachers
Result: Teachers avoid helping struggling students (looks bad)
```

**Mitigation:**
- Clear usage guidelines
- Monitor actual usage
- Regular audits

## üìä Fairness Metrics

### Confusion Matrix by Group

```python
# Binary classification (e.g., loan approval)
# Compare across groups (e.g., gender)

          Actual
          Pos    Neg
Pred Pos  TP     FP
     Neg  FN     TN

# For males:
TP_m, FP_m, FN_m, TN_m

# For females:
TP_f, FP_f, FN_f, TN_f
```

### Key Fairness Metrics

**1. Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity)**
```python
# Equal positive prediction rates across groups

def demographic_parity(y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    """
    P(≈∑=1 | A=a) = P(≈∑=1 | A=b) for all groups a, b

    Example: 50% approval rate for men AND women
    """
    groups = np.unique(sensitive_attr)
    rates = {}

    for group in groups:
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        rates[group] = np.mean(y_pred[mask])

    # Check if rates are similar (within threshold)
    max_diff = max(rates.values()) - min(rates.values())

    return max_diff < 0.05  # 5% threshold

# Example
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
gender = np.array(['M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F'])

male_approval = y_pred[gender == 'M'].mean()  # 2/3 = 0.67
female_approval = y_pred[gender == 'F'].mean()  # 1/3 = 0.33

diff = abs(male_approval - female_approval)  # 0.34
print(f"Demographic parity violated: {diff:.2f}")

# Problem: Ignores ground truth!
# Could approve unqualified men to match rates
```

**2. Equal Opportunity**
```python
# Equal true positive rates across groups
# P(≈∑=1 | y=1, A=a) = P(≈∑=1 | y=1, A=b)

def equal_opportunity(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    """
    Among qualified applicants, equal approval rates

    Better than demographic parity (considers ground truth)
    """
    groups = np.unique(sensitive_attr)
    tpr_dict = {}

    for group in groups:
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        y_true_group = y_true[mask]
        y_pred_group = y_pred[mask]

        # True Positive Rate (Recall) for this group
        tp = np.sum((y_true_group == 1) & (y_pred_group == 1))
        fn = np.sum((y_true_group == 1) & (y_pred_group == 0))

        tpr = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
        tpr_dict[group] = tpr

    # Check difference
    max_diff = max(tpr_dict.values()) - min(tpr_dict.values())

    return max_diff < 0.05  # 5% threshold

# Example
y_true = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # All qualified
y_pred = np.array([1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0])  # Some approved
gender = np.array(['M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F'])

male_tpr = 2/3  # 2 approved out of 3 qualified
female_tpr = 1/3  # 1 approved out of 3 qualified

print(f"Equal opportunity violated: {abs(male_tpr - female_tpr):.2f}")
```

**3. Equalized Odds**
```python
# Equal TPR AND equal FPR across groups
# P(≈∑=1 | y, A=a) = P(≈∑=1 | y, A=b) for y ‚àà {0,1}

def equalized_odds(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    """
    Both qualified and unqualified treated fairly
    """
    groups = np.unique(sensitive_attr)
    metrics = {}

    for group in groups:
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        y_true_group = y_true[mask]
        y_pred_group = y_pred[mask]

        # TPR (True Positive Rate)
        tp = np.sum((y_true_group == 1) & (y_pred_group == 1))
        fn = np.sum((y_true_group == 1) & (y_pred_group == 0))
        tpr = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0

        # FPR (False Positive Rate)
        fp = np.sum((y_true_group == 0) & (y_pred_group == 1))
        tn = np.sum((y_true_group == 0) & (y_pred_group == 0))
        fpr = fp / (fp + tn) if (fp + tn) > 0 else 0

        metrics[group] = {'tpr': tpr, 'fpr': fpr}

    # Check differences
    tpr_diff = max(m['tpr'] for m in metrics.values()) - min(m['tpr'] for m in metrics.values())
    fpr_diff = max(m['fpr'] for m in metrics.values()) - min(m['fpr'] for m in metrics.values())

    return tpr_diff < 0.05 and fpr_diff < 0.05
```

**4. Predictive Parity**
```python
# Equal precision across groups
# P(y=1 | ≈∑=1, A=a) = P(y=1 | ≈∑=1, A=b)

def predictive_parity(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    """
    Among those predicted positive, equal success rates
    """
    groups = np.unique(sensitive_attr)
    ppv_dict = {}  # Positive Predictive Value (Precision)

    for group in groups:
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        y_true_group = y_true[mask]
        y_pred_group = y_pred[mask]

        tp = np.sum((y_true_group == 1) & (y_pred_group == 1))
        fp = np.sum((y_true_group == 0) & (y_pred_group == 1))

        ppv = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
        ppv_dict[group] = ppv

    max_diff = max(ppv_dict.values()) - min(ppv_dict.values())

    return max_diff < 0.05
```

### Impossibility Theorem

**Important:** You CANNOT satisfy all fairness metrics simultaneously!

```
Example:
- Demographic Parity: Equal approval rates
- Predictive Parity: Equal precision
- Equal Opportunity: Equal TPR

If base rates differ between groups:
P(y=1 | A=male) ‚â† P(y=1 | A=female)

Then you CANNOT have all three!

Trade-off decision depends on:
- Application context
- Stakeholder values
- Legal requirements
```

### Choosing the Right Metric

| Use Case | Recommended Metric | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Loan Approval | Equal Opportunity | Qualified applicants should have equal chance |
| Hiring | Equalized Odds | Fair treatment for qualified AND unqualified |
| Medical Diagnosis | Equal Opportunity | Don't miss sick patients in any group |
| Advertising | Demographic Parity | Equal exposure to opportunities |
| Criminal Justice | Equalized Odds | Fair treatment regardless of ground truth |

## üõ†Ô∏è Bias Mitigation

### Pre-Processing: Fix the Data

**1. Reweighting**
```python
# Give higher weight to underrepresented groups

def compute_sample_weights(y, sensitive_attr):
    """
    Reweight samples to achieve demographic parity
    """
    from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight

    # Combine label and sensitive attribute
    combined = [f"{label}_{group}" for label, group in zip(y, sensitive_attr)]

    # Compute weights
    weights = compute_sample_weight('balanced', combined)

    return weights

# Usage in training
weights = compute_sample_weights(y_train, gender_train)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=weights)
```

**2. Resampling**
```python
# Oversample minority groups, undersample majority

from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

def fair_resampling(X, y, sensitive_attr, target_group='Female'):
    """
    Balance dataset across sensitive groups
    """
    # Split by group
    mask_target = sensitive_attr == target_group
    mask_other = ~mask_target

    X_target, y_target = X[mask_target], y[mask_target]
    X_other, y_other = X[mask_other], y[mask_other]

    # Oversample target group
    smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
    X_target_over, y_target_over = smote.fit_resample(X_target, y_target)

    # Undersample other group
    rus = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42)
    X_other_under, y_other_under = rus.fit_resample(X_other, y_other)

    # Combine
    X_balanced = np.vstack([X_target_over, X_other_under])
    y_balanced = np.hstack([y_target_over, y_other_under])

    return X_balanced, y_balanced

X_fair, y_fair = fair_resampling(X_train, y_train, gender_train)
model.fit(X_fair, y_fair)
```

**3. Remove Sensitive Features**
```python
# Drop sensitive attributes (doesn't always work - proxies exist!)

def remove_sensitive_features(X, sensitive_cols):
    """
    Remove sensitive features from training

    Warning: Correlated features may act as proxies!
    """
    X_clean = X.drop(columns=sensitive_cols)

    return X_clean

# Remove gender, race
X_clean = remove_sensitive_features(X, ['gender', 'race'])

# Problem: ZIP code may be proxy for race
# Solution: Also remove correlated features
```

### In-Processing: Fair Training

**1. Adversarial Debiasing**
```python
# Train model that can't predict sensitive attribute

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class FairClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()

        # Main classifier
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

        # Adversary (tries to predict sensitive attribute)
        self.adversary = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):

**2. Fairness Constraints**
```python
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity

# Optimize for accuracy subject to fairness constraint

mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(
    estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    constraints=DemographicParity(),  # or EqualizedOdds()
    eps=0.05  # Max disparity allowed
)

mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=gender_train)

y_pred = mitigator.predict(X_test)

# Check fairness
dp_diff = demographic_parity_difference(
    y_test, y_pred, sensitive_features=gender_test
)
print(f"Demographic Parity Difference: {dp_diff:.3f}")  # Should be < 0.05
```

### Post-Processing: Adjust Predictions

**1. Threshold Optimization**
```python
from fairlearn.postprocessing import ThresholdOptimizer

# Find different thresholds for each group

postprocessor = ThresholdOptimizer(
    estimator=trained_model,
    constraints='equalized_odds',  # or 'demographic_parity'
    objective='accuracy_score'
)

postprocessor.fit(X_val, y_val, sensitive_features=gender_val)

# Predict with fair thresholds
y_pred_fair = postprocessor.predict(
    X_test,
    sensitive_features=gender_test
)

# Different thresholds for different groups
# E.g., threshold=0.4 for women, threshold=0.6 for men
```

**2. Calibration**
```python
# Ensure predicted probabilities are calibrated across groups

from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

def calibrate_by_group(model, X, y, sensitive_attr):
    """
    Calibrate model separately for each group
    """
    calibrated_models = {}

    for group in np.unique(sensitive_attr):
        mask = sensitive_attr == group

        # Calibrate on this group
        calibrated = CalibratedClassifierCV(
            model,
            method='isotonic',
            cv='prefit'
        )
        calibrated.fit(X[mask], y[mask])

        calibrated_models[group] = calibrated

    return calibrated_models

# Predict with calibrated models
def predict_calibrated(models, X, sensitive_attr):
    predictions = np.zeros(len(X))

    for group, model in models.items():
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        predictions[mask] = model.predict_proba(X[mask])[:, 1]

    return predictions
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Differential Privacy

```python
# Add noise to protect individual privacy

def differentially_private_mean(data, epsilon=1.0):
    """
    Compute mean with differential privacy

    epsilon: Privacy budget (smaller = more private)
    """
    true_mean = np.mean(data)

    # Add Laplace noise
    sensitivity = (max(data) - min(data)) / len(data)
    noise = np.random.laplace(0, sensitivity / epsilon)

    private_mean = true_mean + noise

    return private_mean

# Example
ages = [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]

true_mean = np.mean(ages)  # 37.5
private_mean = differentially_private_mean(ages, epsilon=0.1)

print(f"True mean: {true_mean:.1f}")
print(f"Private mean: {private_mean:.1f}")  # ~37.5 ¬± noise

# Privacy guarantee: Can't determine if specific person is in dataset
```

### Federated Learning

```python
# Train on decentralized data without sharing

class FederatedLearning:
    def __init__(self, global_model):
        self.global_model = global_model

    def train_round(self, client_datasets):
        """
        One round of federated learning

        1. Send global model to clients
        2. Clients train locally
        3. Aggregate client updates
        4. Update global model
        """
        client_weights = []

        # Each client trains locally
        for client_data in client_datasets:
            # Copy global model
            local_model = copy.deepcopy(self.global_model)

            # Train on local data (private!)
            local_model.fit(client_data['X'], client_data['y'])

            # Send back weights (not data!)
            client_weights.append(local_model.get_weights())

        # Aggregate (e.g., average)
        avg_weights = np.mean(client_weights, axis=0)

        # Update global model
        self.global_model.set_weights(avg_weights)

        return self.global_model

# Benefits:
# - Data stays on device
# - Privacy preserved
# - Used by: Google (Gboard), Apple (Siri)
```

## üîç Transparency & Explainability

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

```python
import shap

# Explain individual predictions

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)  # For tree models
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Visualize feature importance
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)

# Explain single prediction
shap.force_plot(
    explainer.expected_value,
    shap_values[0],
    X_test[0]
)

# Check for bias
# If "gender" has high SHAP value ‚Üí potential bias
```

### Model Cards

```markdown
# Model Card: Loan Approval Classifier

## Model Details
- **Developed by:** Financial ML Team
- **Model type:** XGBoost Classifier
- **Version:** 2.1.0
- **Date:** 2024-01-15

## Intended Use
- **Primary use:** Automate initial loan application screening
- **Out-of-scope:** Final loan decisions (human review required)

## Training Data
- **Dataset:** Historical loan applications (2010-2023)
- **Size:** 500,000 samples
- **Demographics:**
  - Gender: 52% Male, 48% Female
  - Race: 60% White, 15% Black, 15% Hispanic, 10% Asian
  - Age: 18-75 (mean 42)

## Performance
- **Overall Accuracy:** 89%
- **Precision:** 85%
- **Recall:** 82%

### Performance by Group
|  Group   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Male     | 90%      | 86%       | 84%    |
| Female   | 88%      | 84%       | 80%    |
| White    | 91%      | 87%       | 85%    |
| Black    | 85%      | 80%       | 77%    |

## Limitations
- Lower accuracy for underrepresented groups
- Historical data reflects past lending bias
- Not suitable for edge cases (self-employed, no credit history)

## Ethical Considerations
- Regular bias audits conducted quarterly
- Human review required for all applications
- Applicants can request explanation for decisions

## Monitoring
- Track approval rates by demographic group
- Alert if disparity exceeds 5%
- Monthly fairness reports
```
